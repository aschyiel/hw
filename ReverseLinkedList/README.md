Reversing a linked-list.
===

Although surprisingly not actually a question in the book --- it's one of those things that I'm supposed to know and always have trouble remembering exactly how it goes.

Note to self:
---
- Think as "forward" instead of "next".
- forward, current, previous.
- current is head.
- forward, and previous aren't at first.
