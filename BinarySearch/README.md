A binary-search through an array implementation.

note to self: Don't get the off-by-one error when passing in the list-size as the initial "right" boundary.

note to self2: Make sure the sorted-numbers your testing against is, well, er, actually sorted first.

note to self3: Don't code when tired to avoid above notices...
